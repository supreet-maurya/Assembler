Files:
*All the files i submitted, asm.cpp and emu.cpp and claims.txt, have my name and student id at the start, along with a declaration of authorship.

The evidence for Assembler including the output files from the 5 test examples has also been uploaded. They are test1, test2, test3 , test_min , test_sum , bubble.asm.
Both of my c++ programs did not show any errors and warnings when i compiled it with
g++ asm.cpp -o a1
./a1 testing_file.asm

Program format and structure:

1. The assembler:

    * with two data structures to store respectively labels and mnemonic table with expected operands.
    * uses a single routine for both passes.
    * detects label erros.
    * consistent and sensible formatting with sensible program structure. 
    * sensible variable, function & type names with explanatory comments.
	    * advanced listing file.
		* assembles test programs.
	  * can implements and demonstrates the instruction SET.

2. The emulator :
		* with three data structures to store respectively memory, mnemonic table with expected operands
		  and a linked list structure word.
    * loads object file, 
    * by giving the instructions like "-befor/-after" , the program can produce memory dump before/after execution.
    * by giving the instruction like "-trace", the program prints the result of program executed.
    * detects errant programs.

Testing:
1. The assembler:

I have tested  4 examples shown as bellow. The errors only occurred in the file test2.asm and 
the program immediately stopped on the second pass. 

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced three output files, listing file, 
error log file and machine readable object file, for each example. 

After comparing the listing files and object file of algo1.asm , algo1.l, algo2.l algo2.o 
with the implemented result given on the assignment, both of them show no difference 
from those provided( if there is different  that is fine too) 
 

1.
#Input: asm test1.asm
#Output: 
a. test1.l 
b. test1.log (without any error messages) 		
c. test1.o

Warnings 
Warning at Line -1 : HALT Instruction Not Found! 
Warning at Line 0 : Label with Name "label" not used but Declared! 

2.
#Input:asm test2.asm
#Output: 
 
a. test2.log (without error messages shown as below but also in log file)

Failed To Assemble
ERRORS :- 
Error at Line 4 : Duplicate Label Found - "label"
Error at Line 5 : No  Label as "nonesuch" has been Declared! 
Error at Line 6 : Valid Number or label Name not Found! 
Error at Line 7 : Operand Missing! 
Error at Line 8 : Unexpected Operand Found ! 
Error at Line 9 : There is a Extra Operand! 
Error at Line 9 : Valid Number or label Name not Found! 
Error at Line 10 : Incorrect Label Name!
Error at Line 11 : Invalid Mnemonic! 
Error at Line 12 : Invalid Mnemonic! 

3.
#Input:asm test3.asm
#Output: 
a. test3.l 
b. test3.log (without any error messages)
c. test3.o

Warnings -- 
Warning at Line -1 : HALT Instruction Not Found! 

4.
#Input:asm test_min.asm
#Output: 
a. test_min.l 
b.  (without any error messages)
c. test_min.0


5.
#Input:asm test_sum.asm
#Output: 
a. test_sum.l 
b.  (without any error messages)
c. test_sum.o


6.
#Input:asm bubble.asm
#Output: 
a. bubble.l 
b.  (without any error messages)
c. bubble.o

2. The emulator:

I have tested 5 examples shown as below. The errors only occurred in the file test1.o and 
the program immediately stopped with an error message on the screen. 
There was no object file for test2.asm as it contained errors!

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced excution data both on the screen and 
output text file for each example according to the usage instruction. 

After running the bin file given, the trace data are the same as 
the implemented result from my own program.

1)
#Input:emu -trace test2.o
#Output: test2.trace
ERROR- INFINITE LOOP DETECTED

2)
#Input: emu -trace test_sum.o
#Output: test_sum.trace

3)
#Input: emu -trace test3.asm
#Output: test3.trace 
The instruction Rather Than Set and Data were Run Successfully 

ERROR-
Invalid Mnemonic Found Due to not Use of Set in Emulator

4)
#Input: emu -trace test_min.o
#Output: test_min.trace

-- Total 7 lines of Instructions Completed

5)
#Input: emu -trace bubble.o
#Output: bubble.trace

-- Total 2426 lines of Instruction Completed
